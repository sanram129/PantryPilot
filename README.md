# PantryPilot - A Smart Pantry Management System

Hello!

This is our GitHub repository for PantryPilot. It is a smart receipt scanner we made during NewHacks 2025, which allows you to scan receipts, save and edit your pantry, and find healthy recipes based on what you have!

With this project we aim to both educate people on healthier food options and cut down on household food waste, which are two very prevalent problems in Canada, especially with costs of fresh food on the rise.
